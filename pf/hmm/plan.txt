-   sample mini points
-   sample major point -- state of hmm
-   find no. of major points in the bowl gamma(log n /n)^1/d
-   want to connect to all, find mini points which lie in their voronoi
        estimate size of vornoi
        sol1
            major node stores r: max distance of it's child minor point
            r* = max{ri s inside bowl}
            rewire all minor points within r*
            --? can store pointers to minor points in major nodes?? (just need to iterate over
                less no. of mini points vs logn query to kdtree
        sol2
            rewire all mini samples within bowl
-   propagate the system from major sample for delt_p
-   integrate the final gaussian over the mini-samples obtained
-   join major points in bowl with edges of these weights
-   update viterbi for sampled major point
        **if y comes in between delt, use it, else add zero
        probabs are propagated using logs, so you are adding everything
        put parent of sampled major as one of the major points in bowl
-   sample beta mini samples
-   rewire parents for mini samples
-   after every delt_p, find the major point with max probab within bowl of gamma(logn/n)^1/d
    (that path is the best curr. estimate)

**  every time a point is sampled, it is given the current t, so there's no need to update
and samples, just incorporate y into the samples in future...


store every time in node
