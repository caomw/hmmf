increasing dt gives a better mean alpha estimate
    find out the reason
        * because nodes do not interconnect at all
        * bowls are smaller wrt dt -- follow this up
        --  infact, in for dt = 0.1, GAMMA = 0.4, bowl is just enough big to connect
            to all nodes of previous observation
        -- do this by design? (awesome ?) :D

curr bug:
    update_viterbi looks for past vertex, it does not find anything


if dt is comparable to sobs, it connects well to the recently sampled vertices also, so, the filtered trajec
loses estimate and lags behind
