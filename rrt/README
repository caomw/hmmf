Instructions to execute the code
================================

Compiling:
    1. make inside the source code folder to compile RRT* code
    2. ./genobs <num_obs> <max_size> > input/obs3.txt to generate the obstacles randomly
    3. RRT* generates a file points.dat which stores the tree and the costs
    4. Plot this using "python plot.py <obs_file>"
 

 Obstacle generation:
    I generated obstacles randomly given a numnber of obstacles.
    90% obstacles are generated within sizes (0.1, 0.5*max_size)
    The rest are generated between (0.5*max_size, max_size)
    The robot location is fixed at (0, 0) and genobs.c takes care
    not to put obstacles that overlap this. However, the goal location
    has to be explicitly chosen. To do this, run the python plotter with
    an empty points.dat file and the newly generated obstacle file.


Matlab histogram code:
    This generated the histogram given the statistics plots from RRT* code.
